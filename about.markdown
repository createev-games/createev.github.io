My name is Andrey.

In my free time I develop cross-platform Apps and Games using C#, Xamarin, Blazor and Unity. Occasionally I share my progress here.

While I have a successful career in business this site is dedicated solely to "creative me" and my personal creative adventures and passions.

## What I am doing now

* Developing multi-currency Accounts app to manage personal finance
